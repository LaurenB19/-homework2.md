After comparing my freshman congresswoman votes to other members of congress, I found some interesting trends. For most if not all, representative Jayapal voted democratic in every scenario. Even in some instances where some democrats voted yes for policy changes, Jayapal stayed very true to voting no. 
But there are some examples where many congressmen and woman, including Jayapal, voted the same way across the board. Many congressmen and women voted yes to remove the sunset portion of section 203. There was one example however where Jayapal decided to not vote at all. 
This came for the voting on the “Duetch of Florida Part B amendment No.” 
This voting concerns the request for redetermination of Part B Florida. I proclaim that my congresswoman did not voter in this situation because this issues seems to only affect Florida and my congresswoman represents the state of Washington.
